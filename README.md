# MaTouch_SimpleOBD2
This example extends the SimpleCan example and adds vehicle OBD2 polling. Code is written to support
2 display sizes, the 2.1" and the 1.28" MaTouch round tft displays.

This example is provided as-is and there are no guarantees this will work for your vehicle.

This code is supplied as a example for:
1) Canbus with filtering on ESP32-S3
2) Reading generic OBD2 using the Canbus
3) Displaying values on tft using LVGL.
4) Simple rotary encoder for user input.

This is a simple test rig for test use in a vehicle.
